  <h1>Team 4: Blake Becerra and Addison Howenstine</h1>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>For Tent Captain</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Captain can log in with their Google account and output a tenting or Walk Up Line schedule by specifying the days and times when a specific number of people are required to be in K-ville (specify when Black/Blue/White tenting are as well as grace)</li>
    <li>Save tenting templates to output multiple spreadsheets for different weeks or Walk Up Line schedules</li>
    <li>Add other members of the tent and keep track of their schedules</li>
    <li>Secure login using Google to simplify spreadsheet export</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>For Tent Members</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>User can add their weekly schedule so tent members can see who is free when. Site can keep track of who is busy at specific times</li>
    <li>Secure login using Google to simplify spreadsheet export</li>

  <h3>Schedule Preferences and Customization</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep track of how many night hours and day hours each member spends in the tent</li>
    <li>Recalculate hours and nights in Kville if there are long unforeseen grace periods</li>
    <li>Some tents may weight time differently, for example counting night hours as a block of hours vs requiring members to spend a specific number of nights in the tent.

  </ul>
  <h3>Notifications</h3>

  </ul>
